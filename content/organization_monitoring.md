This guide provides you with advice on how to best protect your organization.

## Configure open enrollment through allowed email domains

We recommend you configure open enrollment in your organization by whitelisting your organization's email domain. You can then distribute your organization's CovidX Url to your members and instruct them to enroll.

## Allow users to join monitoring groups on sign-up

You can set groups as open-access which allows all members to freely join the group through their `Settings` panel. This can greatly facilitate initial onboarding of your organization by instructing each member to join their relevant group.

## Ask your members to check-in with CovidX before work

Enforcement and compliance is up to you. We advise you to ask your members to check-in with the app once a day, before reporting to work. Mandating that employees check in with CovidX before reporting to work will help keep your work place safe, and provide you with records of compliance.

## Assign managers to be responsible for monitoring groups

We recommend you assign managers to be responsible for checking on their groups and enforcing your compliance rules.

## Enable daily email notifications to members

We recommend you enable daily email reminders to members who did not complete their CovidX check-ins.
