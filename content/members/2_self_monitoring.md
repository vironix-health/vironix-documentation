## Overview

CovidX provides your with access to on-demand self-assessments.

## How to begin an assessment?

You can begin a self-monitoring assessment by going to your home page and pressing the **Begin** button at the center of your dashboard. The process is composed of a few questions about your symptoms, vitals and potential exposure.

If you have completed your daily assessment, or made a mistake, you can still take another assessment.

> We recommend you check in with CovidX daily even if your symptoms or vitals haven't changed. Frequent usage helps CovidX's algorithms better understand your baseline health.
