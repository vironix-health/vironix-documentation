## Overview

CovidX keeps track of your vital signs and health scores. This information allows our algorithms to detect deviations from your baseline health. You can visualize this information by accessing your health charts.

## Vital Signs

CovidX keeps track of your vital sign entries over time and makes them available to you to track. Each vital sign number on your home screen represents an estimate of your normal oxygen saturation, heart rate, and temperature over the past month. This is accomplished by calculating both interday and intraday moving averages. To see how your vitals have been trending over time, you can click on any of the vital sign entries in the home screen to open a chart of your history.

If you find yourself chronically dizzy, tired, or short of breath and you are seeing a downtrend in your oxygen saturation or an uptrend in your heart rate, you should contact your healthcare provider to discuss.

## Accessing charts

You can view your charts by either click on the vital signs on your home page, or through the charts button in your sidebar.
