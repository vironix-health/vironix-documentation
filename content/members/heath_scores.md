# Overview

CovidX health scores are designed to summarize the influence of both a potential viral infection (Covid-19 health score) and your breathing state (Lung health score) on your overall health condition. They are calculated and updated every time you interact with CovidX and . The higher the score the better!

# What influences my health scores?

When you run the “Daily Self-Check” process, The CovidX machine-learning algorithms interpret your inputs to estimate the severity of your signs, symptoms, baseline health, and potential flare-up. These get combined into an overall health score that takes into consideration inputted health data from the previous 30 days.

Remember that the score is interpreting all of your health data, so even if you’re a person without symptoms or concerning vital signs, you may not have a perfect health score as demographic characteristics like age, height, weight, alternate diagnoses, etc also factor into the scoring.
