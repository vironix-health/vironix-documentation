When inviting a member to join your account you can assign one of three roles that all have different permissions.

1. **Owner**

- Can access billing information

2. **Admin**

- Can invite, edit and delete other members.
- Can add, edit and remove members from groups and locations.
- Can edit organization settings.
- Can view all organization reports.

3. **Manager**

- Can access employer dashboard
- Can view group reports in which they are a manager of.

4. **Member**

- Can access member portal
- Can perform daily check-ins
- Can view and edit personal health information
- Can view vital sign and health charts

Roles are staggered, so any role higher up the list has all the rights of the roles below him/her.

Only the initial account creator has the **Owner** role. At the moment, you cannot change the **Owner** role.
